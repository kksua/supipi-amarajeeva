# Supipi Amarajeeva â€“ Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio built with React.js to showcase some of the key projects I have developed during my studies and internships. It includes full-stack web applications, mobile apps, and AI-powered tools, reflecting my interests in software engineering and user-focused solutions. The portfolio is fully responsive and designed to be both functional and easy to navigate.
